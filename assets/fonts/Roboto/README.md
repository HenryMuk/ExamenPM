Place the Roboto font files here before building the web app.

Required files (recommended):
- Roboto-Regular.ttf
- Roboto-Bold.ttf (weight: 700)

You can download these from Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) and copy them into this folder. After adding the files, run:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter clean
flutter run -d chrome
```
